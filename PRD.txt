			Requirements gathering and analysis: Calculator 

	This document specifies the functional requirements for multi-functional program. The program is designed with the usual standard functions (add, subtract, multiply, divide and equal). It is designed to be easy to use as regular calculator.
	The program will be written in standard C++, as compiled by the GNU C++ compiler(g++). It shall use only standard C++ library functions. The program shall be usable on any system which supports the g++ compiler. In addition to decimal, the calculator will be able to convert numbers to binary or hexadecimal. 
	INPUT:
	The input function will accept input from the terminal, validate the input, and then send that input to the calculate function. 
	cin <number> 
	cin [arithmetic operator]
	cin <number>
	
An <arithmetic operator> is one of:
	+ for addition
	- for subtraction
	* for multiplication
	/ for division

If an illegal operator is detected, an error message is to be printed.
	OUTPUT:
	This function will display the results of a calculator. Results should be displayed when the equals sign ( = ) is input.
	
	Converter:
	To enable convert mode, at the first user should input:
	cin [converter]
	and switch again to calculator
	cin [calculator]
